# Contributing Guidelines ðŸš€

Thank you for considering contributing to CodeLab Open Source! We appreciate your efforts to improve CodeLab and help the community grow.

## Getting Started

1. **Search for Existing Issues**: Before starting any work, please check if there is already an existing issue related to your contribution.
2. **Creating a New Issue**:
    - If no issue exists, you can create one for:
        - Bug fixes
        - New features
        - Documentation improvements
    - Please provide a clear and detailed description.
3. **Issue Approval**:
    - The maintainers will review the issue to determine if it is valid and aligns with the project goals.
    - Once approved, you can assign the issue to yourself and start working on it.

## Pull Request (PR) Guidelines

1. **Issue Reference**:
    - All PRs must reference a GitHub issue (e.g., "Fixes #123").
    - PRs without a corresponding issue number will not be reviewed.
2. **Branching**:
    - All branch names should start with YOUR name in order for Codelab to recognize your contribution.
    - Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `Aaryan/add-slider`, `Nandini/typo-in-readme`).
4. **Commit Messages**:
    - Write clear, concise commit messages.
    - Follow the format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` (e.g., `fix(auth): correct password validation`).
5. **Code Reviews**:
    - PRs will be reviewed by maintainers or designated reviewers.
    - Address any feedback provided promptly.

## Code Quality

- Follow industry coding standards.
- To properly format code, use ```npm run format``` to run prettier before committing any code.
- To check for errors, run ```npm run lint``` to the code. This should pass without any errors before commits. 
- Ensure code is clean and well-documented.
- A lot of people are working on this project, so adding comments will help explain your goal with the code you've written.
- Avoid including unrelated changes in a single PR. If you think there is something that needs to be fixed, open a new issue for it or contact a maintainer on Discord. 

## Communication

- Be respectful and considerate in all interactions.
- Use GitHub Discussions or Issues for any questions or clarifications.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license as the project.

Thank you for your contribution! Happy coding!
