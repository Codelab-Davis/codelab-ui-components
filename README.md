# 🚀 CodeLab Open Source

Welcome to  **CodeLab Open Source - Component Library**, a collection of beautifully designed, reusable UI components built with **Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN, and Storybook**. This project is **licensed under the MIT License**, making it free to use and contribute to.

## ✨ Tech Stack

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** – React framework for SSR, API routes, and performance optimization.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** – Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.
- **[ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/)** – A customizable component library based on Radix UI.
- **[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)** – A UI development environment for building and testing components in isolation.

## 🛠 Custom Design Approach

We use **ShadCN** components as the foundation and apply **our own custom styles** on top of them. This allows us to:

- Maintain **consistency** across the component library.
- Ensure components **align with our design system**.
- Keep up with **ShadCN updates** while having our own unique look.
