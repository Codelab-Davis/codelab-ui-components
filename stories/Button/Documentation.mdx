## Examples

### As a Link
You can use the button as a link using the `asChild` prop with Next.js Link or anchor tags:

```tsx
import Link from "next/link"

<Button asChild>
  <Link href="/about">About Page</Link>
</Button>
```

### With Icon
You can add icons to your buttons:

```tsx
import { Mail } from "lucide-react"

<Button>
  <Mail className="mr-2" />
  Login with Email
</Button>
```

### Disabled State
Buttons can be disabled using the `disabled` prop:

```tsx
<Button disabled>
  Please wait...
</Button>
```

## Best Practices

1. Use the appropriate variant to communicate the button's importance
2. Keep button text concise and action-oriented
3. Use icons sparingly and ensure they add meaningful context
4. Maintain consistent button sizing within the same context
5. Ensure sufficient color contrast for accessibility

## Accessibility

- Supports keyboard navigation
- Works with screen readers
- Maintains focus states
