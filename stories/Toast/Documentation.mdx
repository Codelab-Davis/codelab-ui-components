2. **Concise Text:** Keep toast messages short and action-oriented.
3. **Action Usage:** Incorporate actions only when they add clear context to the notification.
4. **Consistent Styling:** Maintain uniform toast styles within the same interface context.
5. **Accessibility:** Ensure that your toasts have sufficient color contrast and clear focus indicators.

The Toast component is built with accessibility in mind:

- **Keyboard Navigation:** Fully supports keyboard interactions.
- **Screen Reader Compatibility:** Uses proper ARIA attributes for enhanced accessibility.
- **Focus Management:** Provides visible focus states to aid users navigating via keyboard.
