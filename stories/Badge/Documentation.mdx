## Best Practices

To ensure a consistent and accessible user experience, consider the following best practices when using the Badge component:

1. **Use concise text**: Keep the text inside the badge short and meaningful.
2. **Choose appropriate variants**: Use the correct variant to match the UI context.
3. **Avoid overuse**: Badges should highlight important information, not overwhelm the interface.
4. **Ensure readability**: Maintain contrast between text and background for accessibility.
