```tsx
<Slider
  min={0}
  max={100}
  step={1}
  defaultValue={[50]}
  hasLabels={false}

```

<Primary />

---

## Variants

The Slider component supports several variants to cater to different design and functionality requirements.

### Default
A basic slider with the default settings.

<Story of={SliderStories.Default} />

### With Labels
Displays labels at both ends of the slider indicating the minimum and maximum values.

<Story of={SliderStories.WithLabels}/>

### With Tooltip
Shows a tooltip that displays the current slider value.

<Story of={SliderStories.WithTooltip} />

---

## Size Variants
Slider supports multiple sizes to fit various interface contexts.

### Small
A compact version of the slider, ideal for tight spaces.

<Story of={SliderStories.Small} />

### Default Size
The standard slider size for most applications.

<Story of={SliderStories.Base} />

### Large
A larger slider for enhanced visibility and interaction.

<Story of={SliderStories.Large} />

## Custom Range

<Story of={SliderStories.CustomRange} />

---

## Examples

### Controlled Slider
A controlled slider example where the value is managed externally:

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { Slider } from "@/components/ui/slider";

function ControlledSlider() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState([50]);

  return (
    <Slider
      value={value}
      onValueChange={setValue}
      min={0}
      max={100}
      step={1}
    />
  );
}
```
 
### Uncontrolled Slider
An uncontrolled slider example that manages its own state internally:

```tsx
<Slider
  defaultValue={[50]}
  min={0}
  max={100}
  step={1}
/>
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Value Management**: Use controlled components when you need to synchronize the slider value with other parts of your application.
2. **Immediate Feedback**: Provide visual feedback as the slider value changes to improve user experience.
3. **Customization**: Leverage available props such as hasLabels and showTooltip to enhance usability.
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the slider scales appropriately across different device sizes.

## Accessibility
The Slider component is designed with accessibility in mind:

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Fully supports keyboard interactions.
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Uses appropriate ARIA attributes to ensure information is accessible.
- **Focus Indicators**: Provides clear focus states to assist users navigating via keyboard.
