## Installation

To integrate the RadioButton into your project, import it from the components directory:

```tsx
import RadioButton from "@/components/ui/RadioButton";
```

---

## Usage

Using the RadioButton component is simple. Here’s a basic example:

```tsx
import RadioButton from "@/components/ui/RadioButton";

export default function TestPage() {
  return (
    <main className="p-8">
      <RadioButton title="Radio Buttons" option1="Comfortable" option2="Default" />
    </main>
  );
}
```

You can change the title and options however you need go to RadioButton.tsx page to change the dimensions of the container. Sometimes the word becomes uneven and you need to go to RadioButton.tsx page to change it.
