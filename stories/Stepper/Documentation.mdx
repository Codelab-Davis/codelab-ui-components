## Best Practices

When using the Stepper component, keep the following guidelines in mind to ensure clarity, usability, and consistency:

1. **Choose the Right Variant:** Select a variant that best matches your use case—use labels for clarity, icons for visual guidance, or both for maximum context.
2. **Keep Labels Concise:** Step labels should be short, descriptive, and easy to scan. Avoid long phrases that may cause layout issues.
3. **Use Icons Purposefully:** Add icons only when they enhance understanding or provide meaningful visual cues for each step.
